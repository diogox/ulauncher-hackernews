# Hackernews (ULauncher Extension)

This is an extension for [ULauncher](https://ulauncher.io/), a mac-like application launcher for linux. 

Warning: Right now the extension is working. However, it is missing a lot of important features and the code is a bit of a mess. I intend to change this is further updates, but I'm a bit swamped at the moment.

For this extension to work, install the following modules:
```
    pip install --user timeago
    pip install --user datetime
```
